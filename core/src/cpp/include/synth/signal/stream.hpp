/**
 * IStream interface
 *
 * An IStream implementation produces a sequential stream of Packet instances. This could be
 * a pure generator, e.g. an Oscillator or Envelope, or something that processes the result(s) of
 * one or more other IStream, such as a Filter or a Mixer. Packets are obtained from the emit()
 * method, which accepts an optional index value of the current packet being evaluated. This
 * allows any stream to detect when it has been asked for the same packet again, which may happen
 * when one stream is being used as a data source for several others, e.g. an LFO controlling
 * several other oscillators.
 *
 * Packets returned from emit() have const semantics. If you need to modify a packet from a
 * stream, you will need to clone it. The main motivation for this is to allow an efficient
 * implementation where packet recycling is easier to manage.
 *
 * A stream can be enabled or disabled. A disabled stream will still emit packets when asked
 * but the disabled packet will be silence (all values zero).
